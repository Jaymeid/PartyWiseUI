# PartyWiseUI

This repository contains a **public cut** of the UI for an active project I’m currently developing.  
It is provided here **exclusively for demonstration purposes** and to showcase the initial design and navigation flow.

- The UI starts from the **authentication flow** and allows navigation into the **main tab screens**.
- There is **no backend connectivity** implemented in this version — it’s purely a frontend prototype.
- All assets included are **temporary placeholders**, and are **not intended for the final release**.
- The up-to-date project is maintained in a **private repository**.
